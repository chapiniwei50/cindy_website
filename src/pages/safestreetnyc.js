          <Typography variant="body1" className="section-description">
          New York is the world‚Äôs largest city by population and as such, the day-to-day experiences of New Yorkers vary vastly. For someone trying to move or visit to New York, there will definitely be concerns around whether the neighborhoods/boroughs they choose to locate to are safe and proximate to key services such as healthcare. The application we create will compile data on NY house/Airbnb prices, crime rates, healthcare locations and demographics, and allow users to find different metrics in each of these fields based on location.

      üò• Technical Challenges
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body1" className="section-description">
      During the development of SafeStreetNYC, we encountered several technical challenges, which we addressed with various strategies:
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body1" className="section-description">
      <b>1. Extremely Large Datasets</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Many of the datasets we used were extremely large, which made certain queries intractable.
        </li>
        <li>
          To address this, we reduced the size of these datasets by selecting only the most essential data. For example, we only considered crimes that occurred in or after 2019.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body1" className="section-description">
      <b>2. Complex Queries</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some queries were highly complex and difficult to optimize for real-time performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          To improve efficiency, we occasionally compromised the accuracy of our results. For instance, instead of comparing all houses in a neighborhood with all local crimes, we used a sample of crimes to approximate crime statistics for different areas.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body1" className="section-description">
      <b>3. GitHub Merge Errors</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Errors frequently arose while pushing and pulling code changes on GitHub, particularly during merges.
        </li>
        <li>
          To mitigate these issues, we worked on separate branches and communicated closely before merging. For smaller fixes, we sometimes resorted to manually copying and pasting code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body1" className="section-description">
      <b>4. Sensitive Information</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Secret keys and sensitive information needed to be securely stored.
        </li>
        <li>
          We stored this information in `.env` files and added these files to `.gitignore` to prevent them from being uploaded to version control.
        </li>
      </ul>
